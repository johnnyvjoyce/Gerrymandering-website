<div class="w3-row-padding w3-padding-64 w3-container">
  <div class="w3-content">
      <center><h1>Committee Members</h1></center>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">The committee will consist of 15 members; 5 Democrat, 5 Republican, and 5 unaffiliated or other. There will be a nearly identical backup committee; all differences between the backup and primary committees will be specified.</h5>

      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Applicants for the committee must meet the following criteria:</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey"><ul>
      <li>Applicants must be 18 years of age or older and must be a United States citizen.</li>

      <li>Democrat and Republican applicants must have voted for their respective party candidates in the previous two state, federal, and presidential elections, with the exception of those who were not legally allowed to vote in those elections. On the other hand, unaffiliated or other applicants must have not voted for a Democratic or Republican candidate in the previous two state, federal, and presidential elections. If an applicant has changed the state in which they are registered to vote, the state elections in which they were registered will be counted.</li>

      <li>Applicants may not have held a political public office in the last 10 years or have been a registered lobbyist with the state of New Regionland.</li>

      <li>Applicants may not have donated more than $200 to any political party and may not have received any gifts or any sum of money from a political party or lobby.</li>

      <li>Applicants may not have participated in the campaigns of political parties in any way, including but not limited to; social media campaigning, fundraising, or creating or displaying party/candidate advertisements.</li>

      <li>Applicants may not be any of the following relations to a political public office holder, campaigner, or lobbyist:
          <ul><li>parent, child, sibling, aunt/uncle, niece/nephew, grandparent, grandchild, spouse, half sibling.</li>
              <li>In-law and step relations are only included for parent and child relations.</li></ul></li>

      <li>Applicants may not have served on the redistricting committee in the past. However, the backup committee may have served on the backup committee in the past, but not on the main committee.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Applications will be received from the public via mail, email, job recruitment boards, and the committee’s official website.</p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">The existing committee may, if they desire, choose up to 5 members from the eligible applicants to be automatically chosen for the committee, with at least 1 Democrat, 1 Republican, and 1 unaffiliated/other. In this situation, in addition to the above criteria, the applicant must not be a relative of the existing members in the committee, following the guidelines described above. The applicant also cannot have met with any of the members of the existing committee more than 3 times before applying. The applicant must receive the approval of 4 Democrat members, 4 Republican members, and 4 unaffiliated/other members. If the committee cannot approve any such candidates (or decide not to), then the next step in the selection process will be executed.</p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">The secretary of state and the New Regionland human resources department will narrow down the eligible applicants into a pool of 50 Democrats, 50 Republicans, and 50 unaffiliated/other applicants. Each sub-pool must be within a 20% error margin of the state’s geographic and demographic makeup regarding gender, race, sexuality, and so on.</p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">From these pools, the majority and minority leaders may choose to remove up to 5 candidates each from each sub-pool, giving a maximum of 30 potential eliminations. Each committee seat will then be filled by randomly drawing from each respective sub-pool. If any of the chosen applicants decline to join the committee, fail to be contacted, or have since been found to be ineligible, the remaining seats will be filled by choosing again at random from the respective pool.</p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">While on the committee, members may not receive money or gifts of any kind from any political party or lobby, or hold any private meetings with elected officials or lobbyists. Members also may not hold any other governmental positions while on the committee.</p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">The committee will be reselected via this process once every 6 years. The backup committee will be reselected once every 10 years. If at any point a committee member can no longer continue for any reason, a replacement will be chosen at random from the backup committee. The missing seat in the backup committee will be filled as a regular job opening by the New Regionland human resources department using the requirements listed above. Those who are chosen for the backup committee in this way cannot be randomly selected for joining the main committee.</p>

  <div class="w3-content">
      <center><h1>Approving Maps</h1></center>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Once a map has been proposed, it must receive approval votes from 3 Democrat members, 3 Republican members, and 3 unaffiliated/other members. If this vote passes, the map will be subject to an approval poll by the people of New Regionland accessible via mail or internet, which will be open for 30 days and will require a 60% supermajority to pass.</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">If no map can be agreed upon for 1 year, it will be passed on to the backup committee, who will take over and follow the same process. If the backup committee cannot agree upon a map after a further 1 year, it will be passed on to the New Regionland Supreme Court.</p>

<!-- Third Grid -->
<div class="w3-row-padding w3-padding-64 w3-container">
  <div class="w3-content">
      <center><h1>Transparency</h1></center>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Each committee meeting requires the presence of at least 11 members, with 3 from each Democrat, Republican, and unaffiliated/other category. Each meeting will be livestreamed and will have room for public audience, though these meetings are not to be considered a public hearing and the committee may dismiss interrupting spectators. At least 10 such meetings must be held before the committee votes on the map, and at least 2 meetings must be held in each geographic quarter of the state.</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">Any software used by the committee must have open source code, and all data and records used by the committee must be made available to the public.</p>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">When each map is proposed, the committee will hold public hearings regarding the map at least 10 times before it is voted on and a further 10 times after it is voted on. Of these hearings, 2 before and 2 after must be held in each of the 4 geographic quarters of the state and they will be livestreamed on the official website with live chat functionality. Priority will be given to audience members who have not spoken yet. If at least 40% of the audience has not had a chance to speak at least once by the end of the hearing, it must reconvene the following day.</p>

<div class="w3-row-padding w3-light-grey w3-padding-64 w3-container">
  <div class="w3-content">
      <center><h1>Map Guidelines</h1></center>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Any proposed map must satisfy the following criteria:</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey"><ul>
      <li>Districts must be of equal population within 5% error and must adhere to the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/history-federal-voting-rights-laws">Voting Rights Act</a>.</li>

      <li>Districts must be contiguous.</li>

      <li>Districts must not discriminate against any ethnic group or community through “<a href="http://www.redistrictinggame.org/learnaboutmission2.php">packing and cracking</a>”.</li>

      <li>Districts must not favour or give advantage to any party, candidate, or incumbent.</li>

      <li>Districts must be demographically representative of the state’s population within a 20% error margin for each demographic.</li>

      <li>Districts must have a Convex Hull measure of greater than or equal to 0.4, where the Convex Hull measure is calculated by dividing the area of the district by the area of its <a href="https://brilliant.org/wiki/convex-hull/">convex hull</a>.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">Town and city boundaries and population density are not necessary to consider.</p>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">It is recommended that the committee considers other compactness measures of districts, such as its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect_ratio">Harris measure</a> (the length of its longest internal straight line divided by the length of the longest line perpendicular to it) and its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polsby-Popper_Test">Polsby-Popper measure</a> (<span lang="latex">\tfrac{4 \pi A}{p^2}</span> , where <span lang="latex">A</span> is the area of the district and <span lang="latex">p</span> is the perimeter of the district), though this is not a requirement and is largely to be left to the discretion of the aforementioned public referendum.</p>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">In the event that any of these criteria are not possible to fulfil, the committee must submit a report to the New Regionland Supreme Court, who will vote on whether to overrule the criterion. Each criterion must be discussed by the committee in its meetings at least once. The final time a criterion is discussed for a given map, it must have been shown to be satisfied through the appropriate software analyses.</p>
