      <h1>How Does This Work?</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">In a district, the candidate with the most votes wins the district. But those districts don't always accurately represent the people.</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey"> Observe the diagram to the right. If the districts were to accurately represent the population's vote, we would expect that blue would have 3 districts and red would have 2. This isn't the case though in the two examples.<br>

      In the middle image, blue has gained a disproportionate advantage over red by ensuring that each district has a majority of blue voters, leaving red winning none. In the right image, red has gained a disproportionate advantage over blue by assigning two districts to be won by blue by a huge landslide; this leaves the remaining area open for districts that have a very small red majority, making them the winner.</p>

      <h1>How Can It Be Prevented?</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">There are many such ways. The voting system or representation system can be changed entirely.</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">The system we use simply chooses the winner to be the candidate with the most votes. While this may be the simplest and most intuitive system, it is not necessarily the best.<br><br>

          One other method sometimes used is called "<a href="https://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/voting-systems/types-of-voting-system/borda-count/"><b>borda count</b></a>". Rather than just voting for a single candidate, a voter can choose to assign preferences to candidates. For example, they may give 5 points to their favorite candidate, then 4 points to their second favorite, and so on. The candidate with the most points is then the winner. This way, voters don't have to commit to a single candidate, and can also support other canditates that they also like.</p>

            <p class="w3-text-grey" style="width: 90%; margin: 0 auto"><font size=2>A YouTube video by user <a href="https://www.youtube.com/CGPGrey">CGP Grey</a> explaining STV and its benefits</font></p>
    </div>
      <div class="w3-twothird">
          <p class="w3-text-grey">However, we can also take this type preferential voting a step further. Instead of giving points to canditates, a voter can list the order that they like the candidates the most. After all the votes are collected, the number of "first preference" votes for each candidate are counted. If there is a majority for one candidate, then they are the winner. If not, then the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and everybody who voted for the eliminated candidate has their vote automatically "transferred" to their second preference; the process of eliminating candidates repeats until there is a winner. This is called "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting"><b>instant-runoff voting</b></a>" (<b>IRV</b>). <br><br>

          We can take this yet another step further and allow for multiple winners instead of just one: this is called "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote"><b>single transferable vote</b></a>" (<b>STV</b>). This has many benefits, such as giving proportional representation, reducing "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_voting">tactical voting</a>" (where one votes for a candidate that isn't necessarily their favorite because they have a higher chance to win), and others which are explained in the video.<br><br></p></div>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">One more beneficial system is called "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_judgment"><b>majority judgment</b></a>". This is where voters rate each candidate on a given scale; for example, it could range from "very good" to "very poor" on a scale of 1-5. When the votes are counted, each candidate has their median rating calculated, then the highest ranked candidate is the winner. This method is also resistant to tactical voting and voters can freely express their opinions of each candidate without having to decide which they prefer over another if there are two that they equally like.</p>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">As desirable as a new voting system may be, it is unfortantely less likely to be passed than a smaller solution. Our proposal is to keep our current system, but to create an independent committee that prevents those in power from abusing the system.

      <h1>Further Information</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">What are some things that a committee like ours should consider? How can it prevent scenarios like the one mentioned earlier?</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">One thing you may have noticed in the <a href=#howdoesitwork>image at the top</a> of the page is that the districts that disproportionately favor red generally don't look "nice". We can measure this mathematically and find ways to test how "nice" a district looks; this is what we call <a href=http://redistricting.lls.edu/where-state.php#compactness>compactness</a>, and there are many different ways of measuring it. <sup>(Remember that this isn't the only way of measuring gerrymandering, because the map layout that disproportionately favored blue was composed of very compact districts)</sup></p>

      <div class="w3-twothird">
          <p class="w3-text-grey">One such method is the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polsby-Popper_Test">Polsby-Popper measure</a>", pictured to the right. We obtain this by measuring the district's area (<span lang="latex">A</span>) and perimeter (<span lang="latex">p</span>). We calculate the measure by <span lang="latex"> \tfrac{4 \pi A}{p^2}</span>; the result we end up with tells us how close the district is to a perfect circle (where a number closer to 1 is more compact and a number closer to 0 is less compact).</p></div>

      </div>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">Another such method is to look at the "<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull">convex hull</a>" measure, which is taken by dividing the area of the district by the area of its convex hull. The convex hull is the smallest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_polygon">convex shape</a> (with no "indents") that contains the district. So in the case of the image to the left, if the <font color="0db7bc">blue</font>(ish) shape is the distrct, then the <font color="green">green</font> crosshatched shape is the convex hull. This measure tells us how convex a shape is, or how many indents there are; the fewer indents there are and the smaller the indents are, the more compact the district is.<br><br><br>

      Our proposal uses the convex hull measure as a formal requirement for the committee to consider. There are many more measures that can be used, which you can read about by clicking the link below.</p>

      <h1>Potential Issues</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">We use measurements such as area and perimeter in calculating compactness. The issue is that these may not always have the value we expect them to</h5>
    <div class="w3-twothird">

      <p class="w3-text-grey">Say we measure the coastline of the island of Great Britain. If we were to use a 1 mile long measuring stick, we would get a certain measurement. However, if we used a 1 meter measuring stick, we would be able to see much finer details, such little outcrops or tiny concavities, and we can notice this on the diagram to the right. This would mean that our measurement becomes higher; we call this the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastline_paradox">coastline paradox</a>.<br>

        </div>
    </div>


    <p class="w3-text-grey"><br><br>This can hugely impact the way we measure compactness. By using a program called <a href="https://qgis.org/en/site/">QGIS</a>, we are able to find the Polsby-Popper measure at various different resolutions for each congressional district in each state. First, we did it with a resolution of 1:500,000, then afterwards with a resolution of 1:20,000,000 (the higher the number, the higher the resoltion). Now observe the map to the left. In districts where the two measurements differ wildly, the color of the district becomes a darker blue. In some cases, this can even reach a factor of over 4 and a half to 1; that is to say, the measurement we get by using a higher resolution is 4.5 times higher, which is an enormous difference. <br><br><br>

        There are still other issues with compactness. For example, a district may have a long, jagged coastline; this would not mean that it was gerrymandered, but it would still have a low compactness score as a result. It is for these reasons, <a href="http://www.redistrictingthenation.com/whatis-compactness.aspx">amongst others</a>, that compactness is not the main goal of our committee, however they will consider the convex hull measure at the bare minimum.</p>
